"""The Manager's conversational persona: admin-facing, history-aware, and
able to actually call tools instead of telling the admin to type a
command it isn't sure exists.

process_admin_message reaches this only after every exact command
(Approve/Reject/Show/Why/Show-open-quotes) has already failed to match, so
casual phrasing still gets a real answer instead of "I didn't recognize
that command." There is no approve/reject tool -- those two mutating
actions stay gated behind the admin typing the exact command themselves.
